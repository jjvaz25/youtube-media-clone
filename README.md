A clone of youtube's media player page. The goal here isn’t to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things – embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.

There are other elements on the YouTube page which are produced with Javascript. These actions which change the page will not be the focus of this project. This project will not contain any JavaScript
